                Fred Again's streaming success can also be contributed to his live performances as he's displayed on tour this last year. He has chosen non-traditional venues, performs epic light shows and has had wrap around stages the eisze of football fields in order to reach the entire crowd. His live DJ sets are free and he aloows his fans to crowd around him, creating an environment no other DJ has produced. He allows for togetherness in all of his performances and his music displays that as well by sampling every day people in his music. Fred Again continues to grow and it's always exciting to see what he will do next.
